<h2>The Benefits of Cloud Computing for Businesses</h2>
<p>I have decided to do my 4<sup>th</sup> Year project on moving to a cloud-based infrastructure from an on-premise infrastructure. This project will discuss what is cloud computing, the different deployment models available (private, public, hybrid) and the cloud services available (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS). Once these have been discussed in depth, I will be talking about 2 of the leading market services available for cloud-based infrastructure (AWS and Azure). These two cloud services dominate the market making up over 51% of all total cloud spent in 2021.</p>

<h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
<p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources such as storage, servers, networking, software, and tools over the internet. Hosting these resources on the cloud as opposed to an on-site infrastructure has many benefits for businesses&rsquo; which will be discussed shortly. These resources are added on a pay-as-you-go basis, which is beneficial to businesses as more resources can be added under heavy workloads, and the opposite for lighter workloads. A cloud migration is directly related to data and IT modernization for businesses. Not only is this topic related to my course, but it is also an important technology in today&rsquo;s world of computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why I choose to do this topic</h2>
<p>The main reason I choose to do this topic was because before I got into college, I had always been hearing about this magical &lsquo;cloud&rsquo; and had no idea what it was. During my three-year college course, I slowly learned more and more about the cloud. Once I graduated my computing networking degree, I decided to do an add-on year to specialize in cloud and data centre operations. I would like to think by now I have a basic understanding of the different types of cloud deployment models and cloud services. According to numerous articles online, 50% of organizations have moved their workloads to the cloud. [2] It is estimated that by 2025, 85% of enterprises will have moved to a cloud-based infrastructure as opposed to an onsite infrastructure. To me it seems that most businesses are moving to the cloud for the benefits it provides, such as reduced IT costs, scalability, reliability, flexibility, security, amongst many others. As this infrastructural move to the cloud is looking optimal for most businesses in the near future, I think as a student it would be quite beneficial to further my knowledge in this field because when I graduate my add-on year, I will be seeking employment in this sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Project Progression - Theory</h2>
<p>So far in my project, I have drafted up a table of contents that will be the basis on how I will progress my work throughout the year. I have done up a rough summary of what is cloud computing along with the benefits it provides. I have talked about the different types of cloud services available, and which one I will be using / talking about in my project, which is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). I have also talked about which cloud deployment models are available (public, private, hybrid) and which model I will select to implement in my project. I am currently working on the literature review for this project and the previously discussed topics are all part of it. The main aspects of cloud computing consist of Virtualization, Compute, Network and Storage. I have yet to start the research chapter for these, but I will go into detail on what each one is and include a diagram explaining them to show my understanding of that given topic, and how it can be moved from an on-premise infrastructure to a cloud-based infrastructure. The next topic to be completed is the research chapter on AWS and Azure. This chapter will include an in-depth review of both AWS and Azure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Once the theory for my project has concluded, this is mainly the previously talked about topics, I will be moving onto the implementation phase of the project. I am proposing that an IT manager within a business is recommending that they move some/all of the resources (storage, compute, network) to the cloud for the benefits it provides. I will be talking about the on-premise infrastructure before carrying out the implementation. The implementation will consist of a scaled down infrastructure of the previous mentioned resources on both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Once I have implemented these resources to the cloud, I will talk about how it was done, and how to migrate the current physical on-site infrastructure to the cloud. This will contain things such as a script to migrate on-premise VM&rsquo;s to a cloud-based service with a PowerShell script.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Once the implementations have been completed, I will be drawing up a conclusion on which of the two discussed services is better suited for a cloud-based migration. This will discuss the unique features to each, advantages, and disadvantages etc. This will also include what type of cloud deployment model will be used, public / private cloud, or the use of both in a hybrid cloud. The option selected will be compared with its competitor with things like cost to implement, deployment times, services available, disaster recovery, security etc. The selected cloud deployment method will more than likely be a hybrid infrastructure with some resources located on the business premises, with some extra resources on the cloud such as virtual machines, storage, and network resources.</p>
